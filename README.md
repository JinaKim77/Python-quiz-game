### Repository Description 
I created a simple, interactive, text-based quiz game in Python, using modules, loops, conditionals, and functions. 
This project is to demonstrate the ability to write correct Python syntax, practice with fundamental programming logic, refactor code using functions, 
and ultimately write a complete Python script that results in a working, playable game.<br>

### Software Requirements
- Python
- A text editor, like Atom or Sublime
- A terminal application<br>

### How to run
`git clone https://github.com/JinaKim77/Python-quiz-game.git`<br>

`cd Python-quiz-game`<br>
